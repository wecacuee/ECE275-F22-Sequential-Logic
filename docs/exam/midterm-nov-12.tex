\subsubsection*{About the exam}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item There are total 4 problems.
  \item Problem 1 and Problem 2 are mandatory. You have the option of doing any one of Problem 3 and Problem 4. If
    you do both, you will receive the best of the two.
\end{enumerate}
\subsubsection*{Problem description}
Design a Mealy sequential circuit which investigates an input sequence X and which
will produce an output of Z = 1 for any input sequence ending in 1010 provided that
the sequence 001 has never occurred.\\

\textit{Example:}
\begin{align*}
X &= 1\, 0\, 1\, 0\, 1\, 0\, 0\, 1\, 0\, 1\, 0
    \\
Z &= 0\, 0\, 0\, 1\, 0\, 1\, 0\, 0\, 0\, 0\, 0
\end{align*}
Notice that the circuit does not reset to the start state when an output of Z = 1
occurs.
