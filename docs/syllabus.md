### Teaching assistant (TBD)

Office hours:  tba 

### Expected time commitment per week

 - Classes: 3 hrs
 - Review and homework: 3 hrs
 - Labs: 3 hrs

### Grading:

Grading is an unfortunate necessity. Grades are based on the following split. Please note the emphasis on homeworks and labs. You can get 60% of the grades just by finishing homework and labs on time.

- Homework: 30%
- 2 mid-terms and final (Oct. 7, Nov. 9, Dec 14): 30% total (10% each).
- Labs: 30% 
- Project: 10%

There will be no make-ups for missed exams.  Plan to be there.
Late work -- generally not accepted without good reason.
Grading will be based on absolute scale 90% (A)/80% (B)/70% (C)/60% (D).

### Project : Pong game in Verilog

We will be learning Verilog throughout the course, less in the class, more in the labs. By the end of the course, you should know enough Verilog to implement a Pong game on the FPGA board. The labs are designed to help you implement a very basic version of Pong game step by step. Final project will be to add a fancier feature to the already implemented pong game.

Here are some examples from what students did last year:

### Approximate Course Outline:

#### Part 1a: Combinational logic design
- The design process (digital systems, rapid prototyping, etc.)
- Combinational logic (Boolean algebra, truth tables, logic gates, etc.).
- Introduction to CAD tools, Verilog
- Optimization (K-maps, minimization, incompletely specified functions, multiple output circuits, multilevel networks)
#### Part 1b: Combinational logic design extended
- Number representation and arithmetic circuits.
- Combinational building blocks (multiplexers, demultiplexers, code converters, etc.)
#### Part 2: Sequential logic design
- Simple sequential circuits: flip-flops, registers and counters.
- Synchronous sequential circuits (state diagrams, state tables, Mealy vs. Moore circuits).
- Design of synchronous circuits using CAD tools.
- Analysis of clocked sequential networks.
- State tables (derivation, reduction, and state assignment).
- Finite state machine optimization.

#### Part 3: Finer details of leaky abstractions
- Implementation technology (transistor switches, NMOS, CMOS, standard chips, PLD's, etc.)
- Noise margins, clock skew, propagation delays, hazards


### Tests

Tests will be closed book, with one A4 size paper as cheat-sheet allowed. Calculators will neither be needed nor allowed.

### Labs

We will have labs throughout the semester. Please attend in person on your assigned lab day. Each student will be provided hardware that can be taken home. By accepting this hardware, the student is agreeing to return the hardware at the end of the semester with shipping pre-paid by the department. University of Maine administrative policy statements

### Mask policy

Masks are required in the class so that people at risk feel safe and welcome to the class.

### Academic Honesty Statement

 Academic honesty is very important. It is dishonest to cheat on exams, to copy term papers, to submit papers written by another person, to fake experimental results, or to copy or reword parts of books or articles into your own papers without appropriately citing the source. Students committing or aiding in any of these violations may be given failing grades for an assignment or for an entire course, at the discretion of the instructor. In addition to any academic action taken by an instructor, these violations are also subject to action under the University of Maine Student Conduct Code.  The maximum possible sanction under the student conduct code is dismissal from the University.  Please see the University of Maine System’s Academic Integrity Policy listed in the Board Policy Manual as Policy 314 (*Date Issued: September 1, 2020): <https://www.maine.edu/board-of-trustees/policy-manual/section-314/>

### Students Accessibility Services Statement

If you have a disability for which you may be requesting an accommodation, please contact Student Accessibility Services, 121 East Annex, 581.2319, as early as possible in the term. Students who have already been approved for accommodations by SAS and have a current accommodation letter should meet with me (Vikas Dhiman Barrows Hall Rm 105) privately as soon as possible.


### Course Schedule Disclaimer

In the event of an extended disruption of normal classroom activities (due to COVID-19 or other long-term disruptions), the format for this course may be modified to enable its completion within its programmed time frame. In that event, you will be provided an addendum to the syllabus that will supersede this version.

### COVID-19

To keep our campus safe, students are expected to comply with all University policies related to the COVID-19 pandemic. For the latest guidance, please visit https://umaine.edu/return

### Observance of Religious Holidays/Events

The University of Maine recognizes that when students are observing significant religious holidays, some may be unable to attend classes or labs, study, take tests, or work on other assignments. If they provide adequate notice (at least one week and longer if at all possible), these students are allowed to make up course requirements as long as this effort does not create an unreasonable burden upon the instructor, department or University. At the discretion of the instructor, such coursework could be due before or after the examination or assignment. No adverse or prejudicial effects shall result to a student’s grade for the examination, study, or course requirement on the day of religious observance. The student shall not be marked absent from the class due to observing a significant religious holiday. In the case of an internship or clinical, students should refer to the applicable policy in place by the employer or site.

### Sexual Discrimination Reporting

The University of Maine is committed to making campus a safe place for students. Because of this commitment, if you tell any of your teachers about sexual discrimination involving members of the campus, *your teacher is required to report* this information to Title IX Student Services or the Office of Equal Opportunity.

Behaviors that can be “sexual discrimination” include sexual assault, sexual harassment, stalking, relationship abuse (dating violence and domestic violence), sexual misconduct, and gender discrimination.  Therefore, all of these behaviors must be reported.

 

#### Why do teachers have to report sexual discrimination?

The university can better support students in trouble if we know about what is happening. Reporting also helps us to identify patterns that might arise – for example, if more than one victim reports having been assaulted or harassed by the same individual.


#### What will happen to a student if a teacher reports?

An employee from Title IX Student Services or the Office of Equal Opportunity will reach out to you and offer support, resources, and information.  You will be invited to meet with the employee to discuss the situation and the various options available to you.

If you have requested confidentiality, the University will weigh your request that no action be taken against the institution’s obligation to provide a safe, nondiscriminatory environment for all students.  If the University determines that it can maintain confidentiality, you must understand that the institution’s ability to meaningfully investigate the incident and pursue disciplinary action, if warranted, may be limited.  There are times when the University may not be able to honor a request for confidentiality because doing so would pose a risk to its ability to provide a safe, nondiscriminatory environment for everyone.  If the University determines that it cannot maintain confidentiality, the University will advise you, prior to starting an investigation and, to the extent possible, will share information only with those responsible for handling the institution’s response

The University is committed to the well-being of all students and will take steps to protect all involved from retaliation or harm.

*If you want to talk in confidence* to someone about an experience of sexual discrimination, please contact these resources:

_For confidential resources on campus_: Counseling Center: 207-581-1392 or Cutler Health Center: at 207-581-4000.

_For confidential resources off campus_:  Rape Response Services: 1-800-871-7741 or Partners for Peace: 1-800-863-9909.

*Other resources*:  The resources listed below can offer support but may have to report the incident to others who can help:

For support services on campus: Title IX Student Services: 207-581-1406, Office of Community Standards: 207-581-1409, University of Maine Police: 207-581-4040 or 911. Or [see the OSAVP website for a complete list of services](https://umaine.edu/titleix/).
