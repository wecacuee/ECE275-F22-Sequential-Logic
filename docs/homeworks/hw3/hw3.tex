\maketitle
Note that to find a ``minimum-cost circuit'', you must find both the SOP and POS
forms and compute the cost of each, and then indicate which is best.

\begin{prob}
  Derive a minimum-cost circuit that implements the function
  $f(x_1, \dots, x_4) = \sum m(4, 7, 8, 11) + d(12, 15)$
\end{prob}

  Derive a minimum-cost circuit that implements the function
  $f(x_1, \dots, x_4) = \sum m(4, 6, 9, 10, 15) + d(2, 3, 5, 11, 13)$
\end{prob}

\begin{prob}
  Derive a minimum-cost circuit that implements the function
  \begin{align*}
    f(x_1, \dots, x_5) &= \sum m(2, 5, 6, 7, 8, 12, 13, 15, \\
    &\qquad 18, 21, 24, 26, 28,
      31)
      \\
      &\qquad + d(1, 4, 14, 23, 25, 29, 30)
  \end{align*}
\end{prob}

\begin{prob}
  Use Quine-McCluskey method to find the minimal SOP for $f(x, y, z) = \sum m(2,
  3, 4, 5)$.
  You can also implement Quine-McCluskey method in your favorite programming
  language as algorithm.
\end{prob}

\begin{prob}
  Use Quine-McCluskey method to find the minimal SOP for $f(x, y, z, w) = \sum
  m(0, 1, 4, 5, 12, 13)$.
  You can also implement Quine-McCluskey method in your favorite programming
  language as algorithm.

\begin{prob}
  Use Quine-McCluskey method to find the minimal SOP for $f(x, y, z, w) = \sum
  m(1, 5, 7, 8, 9, 13, 15) + d(4, 14)$.

\begin{prob}
  A circuit with two outputs has to implement the following functions
  \begin{align}
    f(x_1, \dots, x_4) &= \sum m(0, 2, 4, 6, 7, 9) + d(10, 11)
    \\
    g(x_1, \dots, x_4) &= \sum m(2, 4, 9, 10, 15) + d(0, 13, 14)
  \end{align}
  Design a minimum-cost SOP circuit and compare its cost with combined cost of
  two SOP circuits that implement $f$ and $g$ separately. Assume the input
  variables in both complemented and uncomplemented forms. 
\end{prob}
